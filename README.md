# hotel_management_system
 The Hotel Management System project should be written in Python. This project file should contain a python script (Hotelms.py). This is a simple console based system which is easy to understand and use. Talking about the system, it contains all the basic functions which include entering customerâ€™s data, calculating room rent, restaurant bill, laundry bill, game bill, and total cost. In this project, there is no such login system. This means the customer can use all those available features easily without any restriction. It is too easy to use, they can check the total cost of staying in the hotel easily with each and every detail.
